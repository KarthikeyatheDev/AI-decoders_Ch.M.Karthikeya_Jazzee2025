# Frapp: Bridging the Design-Dev Divide with AI

## 🚀 Project Idea

**Frapp** is an innovative hackathon project designed to revolutionize UI/UX development. Our vision is to create a fully automated, AI-powered tool that converts design mockups (from Figma links or even screenshots) directly into clean, modular, and production-ready React Native code. This aims to eliminate the costly and time-consuming manual conversion process, fostering seamless collaboration and accelerating product development.

## ✨ Key Features (Proposed)

* **🔗 Figma Link / UX Screenshot Input:** Easily ingest design concepts.
* **🧠 AI-Powered Code Generation:** Automatic conversion to React Native code using advanced Gen-AI models (GPT-4o / Claude).
* **👨‍💻 Live Code Preview:** See generated code rendered instantly.
* **📱 Mobile Ready Output:** Responsive design, adaptable for various screen sizes.
* **🛠️ "Refactor Code" Option:** Regenerate code using different UI libraries.
* **🧠 "Explain Code" Button:** AI explains component functionality in plain English.
* **🎨 AI Theme Generator:** Instantly apply new themes to the generated UI.
* **📂 Easy Export Options:** One-click copy, download ZIP, or direct integration with platforms like CodeSandbox/StackBlitz/GitHub.


## 💡 How It Will Work (High-Level Workflow)

1.  **Input Design:** User provides a Figma public link or uploads a UX screenshot to Frapp's web interface.
2.  **AI Backend Processing:** Our Node.js + Express backend receives the input, uses Figma's API (if applicable) to extract design data, and feeds it into a Gen-AI model.
3.  **Code Generation:** The Gen-AI (GPT-4o/Claude) intelligently parses the layout and design properties, then synthesizes clean, modular React Native code.
4.  **Output & Features:** The generated code is displayed with a live preview. Users can then leverage AI-powered features like "Refactor Code," "Explain Code," and "Theme Generator" to refine their output.
5.  **Export:** Users can easily copy, download, or export the code to popular development environments.
